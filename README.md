## Dean Luckham

### Software Development Student

Hi, my name is Dean Luckham, I'm a student based in West Sussex, UK, studying BSc Computing & IT (Software) part time with the Open University. I'm a self taught developer hoping to expand my skills and knowledge through my time studying.

My [website](https://deanluckham.dev) is a work in progress that I'm using as a learning experience, so it might not always work exactly as intended.
