I've just got this blog up and running so this is my first ever post here!</p><h2>About Me</h2><p>I'm currently studying part-time with the Open University working towards BSc Computing & IT (Software). I have some prior experience programming from self-teaching over the years including Python, C++, Java, Kotlin, Javascript and Typescript. I started developing this site as a personal project to develop my knowledge and skills, it's constantly under development and I'm always looking at new things I can add or things that I can improve.</p><p>In my free time away from my computer I'm normally enjoying the south downs by bike or foot, exploring and slaying monsters in the Kingdom of Hyrule, or staying fresh and splatting squids in Splatsville.</p><h2>Open University</h2><p>I started my studies with the Open University earlier this year, and I'm currently partway through my second module. I'm planning to talk here about my experiences studying with the OU, what I think of the modules and material, how I'm finding the exams, and anything else I feel like discussing.</p><h3>TM111</h3><p>The first module of the Computing & IT degree is <em>TM111 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 1</em>. As the name suggests this serves as a basic introduction to the subject covering things like the development of the computer, basic HTML, programming in OU Build (the OU's lightly modified version of Scratch), and network and internet technologies.</p><p>It seems to serve its purpose just fine and gives a good overview of the basic concepts, the OU needs these modules to bring everyone up to speed because of the variety of student backgrounds. This does mean though that for those with prior experience or qualifications in IT this will likely be a very easy and dull module. I got through the material easily and quickly and blazed through the TMAs without any issues (well, except for losing marks for not showing enough of the really basic working in maths questions, damn you A-Level Further Maths!) and passed the module with a Distinction.</p><p>One down, many more to go.</p><h3>TM112</h3><p><em>TM112 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 2</em> is the direct follow on from TM111 covering more regarding technology, data and the internet. This module also focuses heavily on programming in Python. Similarly to TM111 previous experience in the area will make this a breeze, which is allowing me to get a good headstart. I am noticing though that a good number of people are struggling with binary and Python and I can understand where they're coming from, the OU material is quite lacking and doesn't do a great job of explaining many of the concepts, so you need to be able to find the information you need online, a critical skill to develop.</p><p>TMA01 is due in a couple of weeks time and I've already completed it. There were some questions on scientific notation, binary arithmetic, some small coding problems and one slightly larger one which i expect some with no prior Python experience with struggle with.</p><p>Next up are TM129 - Technologies in practice & MST124 - Essential mathematics 1 which I'm looking forward to and should serve as a good refresher of my A-Level maths.</p><p><br></p><p>That's all I have for now, thanks for joining me on my journey. Now it's time to get back to work.</p></div>",previewContent:"<p><em class='text-secondary font-bold'>Hey,</em> my name is Dean and this is my blog where I'll be talking about my time studying with
