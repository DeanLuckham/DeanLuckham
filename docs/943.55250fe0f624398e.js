I've just got this blog up and running so this is my first ever post here!</p>\n        <h2>About Me</h2>\n        <p>I'm currently studying part-time with the Open University working towards BSc Computing & IT (Software).\n        I have some prior experience programming from self-teaching over the years including Python, C++, Java, Kotlin,\n        Javascript and Typescript. I started developing this site as a personal project to develop my knowledge and\n        skills, it's constantly under development and I'm always looking at new things I can add or things that I can\n        improve.</p>\n        <p>In my free time away from my computer I'm normally enjoying the south downs by bike or foot, exploring and\n        slaying monsters in the Kingdom of Hyrule, or staying fresh and splatting squids in Splatsville.</p>\n        <h2>Open University</h2>\n        <p>I started my studies with the Open University earlier this year, and I'm currently partway through my second\n        module. I'm planning to talk here about my experiences studying with the OU, what I think of the modules and\n        material, how I'm finding the exams, and anything else I feel like discussing.</p>\n        <h3>TM111</h3>\n        <p>The first module of the Computing & IT degree is\n        <a href='https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/tm111'>TM111 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 1</a>.\n        As the name suggests this serves as a basic introduction to the subject covering things like the development of\n        the computer, basic HTML, programming in OU Build (the OU's lightly modified version of Scratch), and network\n        and internet technologies.</p><p>It seems to serve its purpose just fine and gives a good overview of the basic\n        concepts, the OU needs these modules to bring everyone up to speed because of the variety of student backgrounds.\n        This does mean though that for those with prior experience or qualifications in IT this will likely be a very\n        easy and dull module. I got through the material easily and quickly and blazed through the TMAs without any\n        issues (well, except for losing marks for not showing enough of the really basic working in maths questions,\n        damn you A-Level Further Maths!) and passed the module with a Distinction.</p>\n        <p>One down, many more to go.</p>\n        <h3>TM112</h3>\n        <p><a href='https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/tm112'>TM112 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 2</a>\n        is the direct follow on from TM111 covering more regarding technology, data and the internet. This module also\n        focuses heavily on programming in Python. Similarly to TM111 previous experience in the area will make this a\n        breeze, which is allowing me to get a good headstart. I am noticing though that a good number of people are\n        struggling with binary and Python and I can understand where they're coming from, the OU material is quite\n        lacking and doesn't do a great job of explaining many of the concepts, so you need to be able to find the\n        information you need online, a critical skill to develop.</p>\n        <p>TMA01 is due in a couple of weeks time and I've already completed it. There were some questions on scientific\n        notation, binary arithmetic, some small coding problems and one slightly larger one which I expect some with no\n        prior Python experience will struggle with.</p>\n        <p>Next up are\n        <a href='https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/tm129'>TM129 - Technologies in practice</a>\n        & <a href='https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/mst124'>MST124 - Essential mathematics 1</a>\n        which I'm looking forward to and should serve as a good refresher of my A-Level maths.</p>\n        <p><br></p>\n        <p>That's all I have for now, thanks for joining me on my journey. Now it's time to get back to work.</p></div>",previewContent:"<p><em class='text-secondary font-bold'>Hey,</em> my name is Dean and this is my blog where I'll be\n        talking about my time studying with the Open University, modules, exams and everything else, and my software and\n        web development journey, including the development of this site.</p>",tags:["Development","OU","TM111","TM112","Personal"]},{id:2,title:"Land of Ice & Fire",author:"Dean Luckham",created:new Date(2023,10,23),previewImgURL:`${n}PXL_20231118_154112657.jpg`,content:`<div class='post-content'>\n        <p>Iceland is a fixture on many bucket lists, for good reason; often referred to as the land of ice & fire\n        Iceland is home to everything from volcanoes to glaciers and is one of the places you can regularly see the\n        Northern Lights, another bucket list item for many. I recently visited Iceland for 5 nights with my Mum & Brother,\n        staying in Reykjav\xedk for the duration of our stay with a handful of tours and activities booked.</p>\n        <h3>Reykjav\xedk, Day 1 & 2</h3>\n        <p>Reykjav\xedk is the capital city of Iceland, and the most northern capital city in the world, home to roughly\n        60% of Iceland's 360,000 people. The city has stunning coastlines surrounded by mountainous peninsulas offering\n        some wonderful views for a walk along the coast.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231116_101443046.jpg" alt="Reykjav\xedk city coastline">\n        <p>One of Reykjav\xedk's biggest landmarks is Hallgr\xedmskirkja, a 74.5m tall church that towers over the relatively\n        low city. For a small fee you can go to the top of the church to enjoy the view, well worth it on a clear day\n        as the views are spectacular.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231117_150639104.jpg">\n        <p>Because of our relatively short stay and the fact that none of us drive we stayed in Reykjav\xedk for the entire\n        duration of our trip, Iceland really doesn't have public transport outside of the capital so getting around without\n        a car outside of tours can be difficult. This isn't really an issue as there are a huge number of tours available\n        from Reykjav\xedk with transport included.</p>\n        <p>Our first tour was a whale watching tour from Reykjav\xedk. November is not the ideal time for whale watching in\n        Iceland; the cold weather means many of the whales and dolphins aren't around, as well as making standing around\n        on a boat very cold. We were lucky enough to see Billy, a young humpback whale who was known to be quite active\n        in the area in previous years; Billy treated us to a great spectacle including some spectacular lunge feeding.</p>\n        <img src="${n}Copy of 20231116-1300-Andrea-Patrick (23).JPG" alt="Billy gives us a wave">\n        <p>In the evening we had booked a Northern lights tour by bus. Iceland is relatively far south for viewing the\n        northern lights, but it is still regularly possible to do so in the winter months. I'd been checking the forecast\n        throughout the day and things weren't looking that great, there was a dense layer of high clouds and the aurora\n        wasn't predicted to be very strong. Still, we set out on the tour hoping for the best. We drove around 45 minutes\n        out of Reykjav\xedk before stopping in a relatively dark area and hopping out to see if we could spot anyting. After\n        a few minutes we noticed a faint silvery glow in the sky, long exposure photos soon confirmed that we were seeing\n        the aurora borealis, the northern lights.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231116_220111674.jpg" alt="The aurora borealis">\n        <p>We had a few other opportunities to see the lights that night, always the same silvery glow in the night sky.\n        If you're really serious about seeing the lights in their full glory then you're better off trying somewhere further\n        north, but they can still be incredible in Iceland.</p>\n        <h3>Golden Circle, Day 3</h3>\n        <p>For day 3 we'd booked the Golden Circle tour. This is one of the most popular tour routes that almost every\n        visitor to Iceland will take. There are a few different variations but they're all similar and all include some\n        of the most famous sights in Iceland.</p>\n        <h4>Stop 1, Keri\xf0 Crater</h4>\n        <p>The tour we'd booked added Keri\xf0 crater to the usual golden circle route, a volcanic crater 55m deep and 270m\n        at it's widest.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_111216838.jpg" alt="A view across Keri\xf0 crater from the crater rim">\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_112555024.jpg" alt="The partially frozen Keri\xf0 crater lake">\n        <h4>Stop 2, Gullfoss</h4>\n        <p>Iceland is quite well known for it's many waterfalls, Gullfoss, which translates as "Golden Falls", is possibly\n        the most well known and one of the country's most spectacular. The name comes from the golden colour of the torrent\n        of water in the sunlight as it plunges down 2 drops, the weather was a little underwhelming for us, but the\n        falls are still a stunning sight.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_124436176.jpg" alt="Gullfoss Falls from the viewing platform above">\n        <h4>Stop 3, Strokkur Geyser</h4>\n        <p>One of Iceland's most iconic sights is its Geysers, hot springs that occassionally discharge a huge blast of\n        water and steam. Strokkur is Iceland's most active, erupting every 10 minutes or so and launching water up to 40m\n        into the air. Strokkur and the surrounding hot springs are a incredible spectacle, demonstrating the power of our\n        planet and Iceland's geologically active nature.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_142929473_exported_97835.jpg" alt="Strokkur geyser erupting">\n        <p>Iceland gets 30% of it's power from geothermal sources, similar to those that create hot springs, you often\n        see the geothermal plants as you're travelling through the country, the other\n        70% comes from hydropower meaning Iceland uses 100% renewable energy. These geysers give a look into the immense\n        power that lies below our feet. It's no wonder Iceland has worked hard to harness that power.</p>\n        <h4>Stop 4, \xdeingvellir National Park</h4>\n        <p>\xdeingvellir is one of Iceland's most historicaly significant sites, it was the location of the Icelandic parliament\n        from 930 until 1798. It is also one of the places where the rift between the tectonic plates that Iceland straddles\n        can be seen most visibly, the landscape is scarred with rifts where the ground has been visibly torn apart over\n        many years and the entire valley is constantly widening and sinking down.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_154112657.jpg" alt="A sunset over \xdeingvellir National Park">\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231118_155032571.jpg" alt="\xdeingvellir National Park">\n        <p>\xdeingvellir national park is one of the most breathtaking places I have ever been with some of the most incredible\n        natural beauty, and perfectly captures the essence of Iceland, an absolute must-see for anyone visiting.</p>\n        <h3>Day 4, Chilling in Reykjav\xedk</h3>\n        <p>For our fourth day we didn't really have plans, so we were back in Reykjav\xedk. We took a walk to the Icelandic\n        National Museum and got some lovely views of the city on our way on this very cold morning.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231119_130109422.jpg" alt="A very cold morning in Reykjav\xedk">\n        <p>In the evening I decided to pay a visit to one of the cities many public geothermal pools. While there are many\n        tourist oriented geothermal pools, the most famous of which is the Blue Lagoon, it's the public pools where the\n        real Icelandic culture can be found. They are cheap, clean, and have fantastic facilities. Laugardalslaug, the\n        cities largest pool has a 50m outdoor pool, children pool, two waterslides, multiple hot tubs, steam rooms and\n        even a mini-golf course. They're a great way to meet locals and get a feel for the pool culture that is so deeply\n        rooted in Icelandic culture; or to just relax and unwind. When the temperature outside is below freezing as\n        it was on my visit, the water is all the more inviting.</p>\n        <h3>Day 5, The South Coast</h3>\n        <p>We'd originally planned to do Snorkelling at Silfra, the "swimming between two tectonic plates" that is a\n        classic activity for a trip to Iceland; but because of some medical issues I wasn't able to do it, so we changed our\n        plans and booked another tour, this time of the South Coast of Iceland.</p>\n        <h4>Stop 1, Sk\xf3gafoss</h4>\n        <p>After a long drive we first stopped at Sk\xf3gafoss, one of Iceland's largest waterfalls at 60m high.\n        Because of the ammount of spray from the falls a rainbow is normally visible on sunny days. Unfortunately the\n        weather had taken a turn for us on this day, so we weren't able to see Sk\xf3gafoss in its full glory. But that didn't\n        stop us climbing the hundreds of steps to the top.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231120_120943793.jpg" alt="Sk\xf3gafoss">\n        <h4>Stop 2, Reynisfjara Beach</h4>\n        <p>Reynisfjara, commonly known as the black sand beach, is famous for its black sand a hexagonal basalt pillars\n        and those are certainly striking and unique features. It's also famous for the sneaker waves that have been known\n        to take the lives of tourists. The warning sign at the entrance to the beach makes the danger clear, never turn\n        your back to the sea.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231120_131712518.jpg" alt="Reynisfjara Beach">\n        <h4>Stop 3, S\xf3lheimaj\xf6kull Glacier</h4>\n        <p>S\xf3lheimaj\xf6kull was one of my favourite places we visited on this trip, and left a real impact. The glacier,\n        despite being one of Iceland's smaller glaciers, is absolutely vast, incomprehensibly so, and yet it used to be\n        so much bigger. Due to the rapid increase in global temperatures as a result of human activity the galcier is\n        retreating by 60m per year; our tour guide recalled how the now famous lagoon that can be seen in front of the\n        glacier never used to be there, instead it was all Glacier.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231120_153447656.PANO.jpg" alt="S\xf3lheimaj\xf6kull Glacier">\n        <p>It's hard to think of a clearer indicator of the effect of human activity on our planet's climate than this.\n        While the sight is truly and incredible spectacle and undoubtedly one of the most breathtaking places I have ever\n        been, it is sad to think of the effect we have had on it. It is especially sad when one considers all that Iceland\n        is doing to try to protect and preserve the environment.</p>\n        <p>If you're in Iceland and you are able to, visit one of the countries glaciers, see for yourself the effects\n        that we are having on the environment of the planet we all share.</p>\n        <h4>Stop 4, Seljalandsfoss</h4>\n        <p>I said Iceland was famous for its waterfalls. Seljalandsfoss is another of Icelands famous waterfalls and\n        has been featured in films, TV and music videos, there's a small cave behind the waterfall that you can access\n        which provides some great photo opportunities.</p>\n        <img src="${n}PXL_20231120_164730802.jpg" alt="Seljalandsfoss">\n        <br>\n        <p>While this was an exhausting trip it was absolutely worth it.\n        I will certainly be going back to Iceland one day to see what else the incredible country has to offer.</p>\n        </div>`,previewContent:"<p>Iceland is often known as the land of ice and fire. It's a country of incredible diversity,\n        from glaciers to volcanoes, black sand beaches to waterfalls.
